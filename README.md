# Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. That's where you come in.

# How to run the application
1. Download the application from my GitHub repository: https://github.com/cjpan/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.
2. Open the index.html file with a web browser to start the feeds list.
3. In the bottom of the page there is a summary of Jasmine, which should report: 7 specs, 0 failures
